I have been attending an awesome summer school at ICTS on Advances in Applied Probability at ICTS. [Find the link here!](https://www.icts.res.in/program/paap2019) There are many interesting things I have learnt here. Things that were related to my interests were the: optimal transport course by Dr Jose Blanchet, non-parametric matrix estimation by Dr Devarat Shah, and a talk on Gaussian mean estimation by Dr Praneeth Netrapalli. Find the videos for these talks on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfxUxlTHnjY&list=PL04QVxpjcnjg_94pKWf8WHFUCdjVAUHp3).
