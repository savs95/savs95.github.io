I have been attending an awesome summer school at ICTS on Advances in Applied Probability at ICTS. [Find the link here!](https://www.icts.res.in/program/paap2019). There are many interesting things I have learnt here. Things I am planning to write about are optimal transport course by Jose Blanchet, non-parametric matrix estimation by Devarat Shah, and a talk on Gaussian mean estimation by Praneeth Netrapalli. These notes will be mainly for my reference, but you guys are welcome to have a look! The videos should soon be up on youtube, but for the moment, have a look [here](http://live.icts.res.in/videos/).
