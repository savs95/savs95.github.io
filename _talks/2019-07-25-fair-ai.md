This talk was a part of the orientation program for the pioneers of the [Masters of Technology in Artificial Intelligence](https://web.archive.org/web/20190820061315/https://eecs.iisc.ac.in/mtechai/) program. The aim of the talk was to introduce the new students to the area of ethical algorithms, by focusing mostly on fair algorithms. The material for this talk was taken from [Aaron Roth's talk on "The Ethical Algorithm"](https://web.archive.org/web/20190820061839/https://www.nyas.org/events/2019/13th-annual-machine-learning-symposium/).
