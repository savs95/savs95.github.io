Presented our poster (joint work with Yujia Jin, Christopher Musco, and Aaron Sidford) at the [Workshop on Modern Techniques in Graph Algorithms](https://sites.google.com/view/dimacswmtga/posters).

**Abstract**:
	We study lower bounds for the problem of approximating a one-dimensional distribution given (noisy) measurements of its moments. We show that there are distributions on $[-1,1]$ that cannot be approximated to accuracy $\epsilon$ in Wasserstein-1 distance even if we know _all_ of their moments to multiplicative accuracy $(1\pm2^{-\Omega(1/\epsilon)})$; this result matches an upper bound of [Kong and Valiant [Annals of Statistics, 2017]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00061).  To obtain our result, we provide a hard instance involving distributions induced by the eigenvalue spectra of carefully constructed graph adjacency matrices. Efficiently approximating such spectra in Wasserstein-1 distance is a well-studied algorithmic problem, and a recent result of [Cohen-Steiner et al. [KDD 2018]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01725) gives a method based on accurately approximating spectral moments using $2^{O(1/\epsilon)}$ random walks initiated at uniformly random nodes in the graph.

As a strengthening of our main result, we show that improving the dependence on $1/\epsilon$ in this result would require a new algorithmic approach. Specifically, no algorithm can compute an $\epsilon$-accurate approximation to the spectrum of a normalized graph adjacency matrix with constant probability, even when given the transcript of $2^{\Omega(1/\epsilon)}$ random walks of length $2^{\Omega(1/\epsilon)}$ started at random nodes.

 This is joint work with Yujia Jin (Stanford), Christopher Musco (NYU), and Aaron Sidford (Stanford).
