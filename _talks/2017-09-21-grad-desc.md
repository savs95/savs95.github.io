Gave a talk in the Microsoft Research (MSR) - IISc theory reading group on the COLT 2016 paper by [Lee et al., “Gradient Descent Converges to Minimizers”](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04915).  

**Abstract**: Gradient descent converges to a local minimizer, almost surely with random initialization. This is proved by applying the Stable Manifold Theorem from dynamical systems theory.
